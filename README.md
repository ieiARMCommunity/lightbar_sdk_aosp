### Overview
-----------
This documentation is focus on JNI API definition of Light-Bar control for IEI IASO-W10B-IMX8M product.
Users can import this JNI library and calling API to implement selfs own apps, so we also provide an instruction about how to import library.

**Support Hardware: IASO-W10B-IMX8M**

API Features:
* Setting color for one set USER LED with 65535 colors
* Setting Two light-bar as breath mode with a specific color
* Setting Two light-bar as wave mode with a specific color

### <a name="JNI_API"></a>JNI Library API definition
-----------

#### setLightBarUserLED
Itâ€™s a useful API for one LED setting directly, note that calling this API can config one LED set at the same time, so user can implement a lopp to calling multiple LED set such as for loop.


Prototype:
    
    setLightBarUserLED(JNIEnv *env, jobjec thiz, jint bar_num, jint led_num, jint red_brightness, jint green_brightness, jint blue_brightness)
    
    - Input argument 1: bar_num with int type
    IASO-W10B-IMX8M has two light-bars, choose 1st light-bar or 2nd light-bar is necessary, so input value is "1" or "2".
    - Input argument 2: led_num with int type
    As above figure, every red border is one LED set, so input value is the one of "1" to "4".
    - Input argument 3: red_brightness with int type
    Select red LED color, value is from "0" to "100"
    - Input argument 4: green_brightness with int type
    Select green LED color, value is from "0" to "100"
    - Input argument 5: blue_brightness with int type
    Select blue LED color, value is from "0" to "100"
